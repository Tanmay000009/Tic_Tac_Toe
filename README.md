# Tic_Tac_Toe
It a Tic Tac Toe game, which I made for MLH Local Hack Day.
You can play 1v1. And it's made entirely on python 3, and it was really fun making it. I explored few concepts and made my own.
Thank you MLH Local Hack Day for these excting, amazing activities.

# How it works
 As mentioned, it is strictly made on Python 3. I have made a predefined board as a function, which gets printed after every users 
 takes a chance. And I subsequently update the value of that position in an array, to player's key ("X" or "O"). Also I have kept an algorithm
 which will check if any player has won, after every 5 moves. 

# Chellenges
 One of the most intresting challenge was how to decide the locations on board, and how to inform player, what are positions. I
 saw many projects online with same proble, so just at starting of my program I display the complete game with positions. Also many programs
 have ignored the condition that a player will win after a minimum of 5 games, which won't affect much here as it's a small program, but can have
 large effects when making a big program which has large memory storage or large time complexity or both.
